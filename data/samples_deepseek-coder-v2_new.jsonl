Import necessary libraries: `numpy` for handling image data, and other possible libraries depending on the complexity of your implementation (e.g., `cv2` for OpenCV which is useful in image processing).\n2. Define a function that takes an input of images represented as numpy arrays (`image_list`) and measures the average intensity over time by iterating through each image, averaging their pixel values to get a single value representing the \"intensity\" at that frame.\n3. Implement some form of normalization or preprocessing if needed (e.g., converting images to grayscale for consistency in measurement).\n4.

Note that this simple approach assumes grayscale images; if you're dealing with color images (encoded in RGB or similar formats), additional steps would be needed to convert them into a common format suitable for averaging, possibly including converting images to a single channel using libraries like OpenCV for more accurate intensity measurements."}

We will use OpenCV if available because it provides robust image manipulation functionalities, but also consider compatibility if using standard libraries like PIL or others supported by numpy arrays.\n2. **Check Image Type**: Ensure that the input `image` is indeed a numpy array and check its dimensions to confirm suitability for cropping.\n3. **Cropping Logic**: Implement logic to crop out the first half of both width and height from the original image, resulting in an image quarter size. This involves using numpy slicing capabilities to extract only the required part of the image.\n4. **Return the Cropped Image**: Finally, return the newly cropped image which should now be a smaller version of the original, appropriately framed based on your logic.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef crop_quarter_image(image):\n    # Check if the input is a valid numpy array and has at least 2 dimensions (width and height)\n    if not isinstance(image, np.ndarray) or len(image.shape) < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a numpy array with at least 2 dimensions.\")\n    \n    # Get the height and width of the image\n    height, width = image.shape[:2]\n    \n    # Calculate the new boundaries for cropping (first half in both dimensions)\n    top_left_x, top_left_y = width // 2, height // 2\n    bottom_right_x, bottom_right_y = width, height\n    \n    # Crop the image using numpy slicing\n    cropped_image = image[top_left_y:bottom_right_y, top_left_x:bottom_right_x]\n    \n    return cropped_image\n```\nThese steps ensure that the function is robust and handles potential issues like incorrect input types or dimensions. This code will work if OpenCV is installed because it uses OpenCV-specific functions implicitly, assuming `cv2` can handle the numpy array type. If using pure numpy methods for image processing, replace all mentions of OpenCV with suitable numpy slicing techniques."}
